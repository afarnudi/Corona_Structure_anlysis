## Corona Structure Analysis ##
This is the analysis code for the "Nanoscale Characterization of the Biomolecular Corona by Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Cryo-Electron Tomography, and Image Simulation" paper submitted to Nature Communications.

A Makefile is provided to compile the code. Unfortunatly a series of directories need to be set up before the code can find and analysis the images in the paper. Please write to the corresponding auther of the paper mentioned above for more information.
